## Purpose
There is no purpose

## About
You've heard of Tic-Tac-Toe, now meet Pic-Pac-Poe. 
This has likely been written by hundreds of people, but it was my first production-ready Python project.

## How to use
Download the `PicPacPoe.py` file, and run it in your command line, just like any other Python script. 
Installing and running Python is beyond the scope of this readme.
